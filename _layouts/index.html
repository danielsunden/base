<h2>Hi Everyone:-)</h2>

<p>
Couple of things have happened over the last few weeks and I wanted to suggest an approach to client comms about our "Living Insights" service. 

<p>
Last week we presented Gavin's splendid video to RBS (I will GDrive a link so everyone can hear the key messages). On the day, it was seen by Kate Cox and Brian Cooper but we've shared the asset with them and it's possible it may circulate or at least be mentioned internally at RBS.

<p>
This has some implications. Most urgently, it means our DRU's knowledge management(KM) product, the "Living Insights platform" is no longer a hazy future vision but is now a tangible asset. Right now. 

<p>
If you are talking to RBS this week about testing and research you need to be ready to mention or answer questions about our public beta, what RBS needs to do to reach Living-Insights-readiness and how the work you are quoting for will inform or benefit from RBS's participation in our public beta.

<p><b>
Let's agree how we're going to describe that when we speak with our customers. Let's say this:
</b></p>


  <ul>
    <li>The service is under rapid development and is currently "in private Beta"</li>
    <li>  Customers are not locked in. They can access and export their raw data files at any time</li>
    <li>  As part of our private beta, we are working with multiple customers but the data sources and outputs are all private and completely segregated </li>
    <li>  In future releases Nile will incorporate aggregated benchmarking data but this will NOT happen until agreement is reached with all customers around IP ownership</li> 
    <li>  All project and service outputs are being delivered to customers off-line in flat-file format</li>
    <li> The publicly available service will be cloud-based. Currently all data and reports are managed privately using processes and security model that are entirely compliant with existing client MSAs</li>
    <li>  We hope our customers will join us on the journey and will work with us to ensure all IP ownership, private data, business competition drivers and performance-related agreements and metrics are completely aligned with their needs</li>
    <li>  Today, we are working with our customers to adjust their research engagement processes to make them "Living-Insights-ready" (this is a bit like a TV being "HD-Ready")</li>
    <li>  "Cumulative value" is a central theme of the service. It explains why so many of our customers are asking for this service</li>
    <li>  Even though we have worked with you for a long time, your research was not being organised and delivered in a Living-Insights-ready format for two reasons a)</li>
    <li>We have always sought to be competitive and the extra cost of this work would have priced us out of the market and b) Achieving readiness implies a certain commitment and organisation on the part of the client and you have not retained us in a way that would have allowed us to deliver cumulative value </li>
    <li>  The pricing model for the service is being reviewed and will be developed in partnership with private beta participants
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Internally, what is our roadmap? Where are we today and what do tomorrow and the day after look like?
</p>

<b>Right this second, Living Insights is:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A crack team of dedicated and experienced smart people
    </li><li>A new approach to planning and executing tests and enquiries
    </li><li>A new approach to organising and sharing research data
    </li><li>A new format for reporting back to customers
    </li><li>A new commitment to RBS that we will invest consultant time in optimising research activities for RBS to ensure their projects are "Living-Insights-ready". There will be a cost associated with that extra effort but this is currently TBC and will be decided by Keely and Sarah
    </li><li>A spreadsheet
    </li><li>Dedicated private data storage area on Nile servers (with no SLA in place, we cannot make 99.9% availability-type claims, at this </li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>In the next two months, Living Insights will become:</b>
</ul>
</li><li>Reports published in the form of web-pages instead of Keynotes. These will initially be very simple and will not be hosted online as our security model and customer MSAs will need to be adjusted and agreed with RBS to allow the cloud-based service to start
</li><li>Data files delivered in the same static file bundle. These data files will grow over time as RBS commissions more work, eventually growing into a human-readable relational database made up of several .csv files which will form the backbone of the service and provide reassurance that the customer's investment is never lost but instead continues to grow fruitfully under the skilful watch of Nile's best thinkers and doers.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>In future phase Living Insights will be fully cloud-based and integrated with more and more relevant tools. This will include: </b>
<ul>
</li><li>Nile's "Real People" Panel
</li><li>Test recruitment and execution
</li><li>Mobile execution and management (the Van(tm))
</li><li>Quant data dashboard a la Watson (using open source software to drive)
many others!
</ul>

Thanks for listening:-)
