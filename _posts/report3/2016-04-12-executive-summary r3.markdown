# Key findings: Positives #

<img style="max-width: 100px;" src="/images/positive-smiley.jpg">

## All participants liked customisation option and would make it their own ##

After trying the prototype and being guided through options to
customise their dashboard, participants saw the value in customisation
and would like to use it in their day-to-day work. They would only have
what they needed on their dashboard and wanted to possibility to
customise the panels even further.

## ‘Notification’ and ‘Your accounts’ panels was liked by all participants ##

When asked what panels participants would have on their
dashboard, all participants wanted ‘Your Accounts’ as long a they
could customise it to show what they wanted. The ‘Notification’
panel on top of the page was considered helpful by all participants
and only one participant wanted the option to close it from the
dashboard.

## ‘Help & Support’ was found and liked by all participants ##

All participants was able to complete the task to find general
information about CHAPS payments in ‘Help & Support’ and
almost all liked the ability to use web chat if they were not able to
find the right answer.

## Security content were generally well received ##

All but one participant did not mind seeing the security warning
after login as long as it was not the same every time they logged
in. All participants liked the security content at the bottom of
‘My Dashboard’, but many of them did not like that it was at the
end of such a long page.



# Key findings: Areas for improvement #

<img style="max-width: 100px;" src="/images/negative-smiley.jpg">

## First use screens’ intended message is not understood or skipped ##

Half of the participants wanted to skip the first use screens that appears
after logging in. These participants either only open their bank account
when they want to complete a task and want to complete this first or
they see what the screens are overplayed and want to see this content
instead.

Many participants did not remember reading about ‘More Bankline’ in the
first use screens, which meant that only one of them was able to guess
what the title meant in the navigation bar.


## There is too much information on ‘My Dashboard’ when opening for the first time ##

When first arriving on ‘My Dashboard’, all participants thought there was
too much information and most participants said that they were unlikely
to see the content at the bottom of the page considering how much they
had to scroll. This gives a bad first impression to the content and needs to
be rethought - if it is not there is a risk of customers just navigating to
where they can complete a task and not use the dashboard.


## More Bankline page is hard to understand ##

Although participants are introduced to ‘More Bankline’ on the First Use
Screen, only one of them is able to explain what they will be finding here
before clicking it. Once participants arrive on the page where they can
read about what they can do with the original Bankline, all participants
start to read what is in the screenshot and most participants try to read
the small text in it, especially the unread messages, and interact with it as
if it was their original Bankline.
The button to ‘Open Original Bankline’ takes a lot of time to find and
participants generally do not know what to expect before clicking it.


## Key customisation options are not found ##

None of the participants were able to find ‘Add Panels’ on their own after
trying to close a panel either because of it being too small or they were
trying to search elsewhere. Only one of the participants was able to move
panels right away, but none of them found it obvious that this could be
done. Settings was not always understood as only for the panel.


## Global search ##

All but one participant did not see the search on top of the page and once
asked about it, all participants expected it to search ‘Help & Support’ or
similar pages and not be able to search for transactions.


# General findings #

## Customers are logging in to complete a task not to try new features ##

All participants said that they only log in to their business banking
account when they need to complete a task. This means that
when they are presented with First Use Screens, they are likely to
press skip. For getting the message of customisation to them,
these screens are crucial as it is not prominent anywhere else on
the page. The danger here is that customers will press skip and not
know they are able to customise their dashboard that all
participants in the testing found to have too much information.

## Other panels asked for by customers ##
Customers was asked if they wanted any other kind of panels that
would fit into how they do their day-to-day job. The following was
suggested:

• Customised panels without large numbers that other employees could see on their screen
• Snapshot of the week per account
• Ability to view one account per panel e.g. ‘Payments awaiting authorisation or release’ for ‘Travel’
• Credit cards management

## Too final wording used when customising and the ability to discard an action ##

When participants are logged into their account, they generally
fell more aware of not messing things up because of what they
usually do in this context is very serious e.g. making transactions,
so an action as “Close” sounds very permanent and not something
one would press unless you know what it is going to do. This
should be a general principle for the customisation, so customers
will fell safe to try customising their dashboard
