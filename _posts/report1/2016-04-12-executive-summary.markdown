# The ‘Add panels’ section for customising the dashboard was missed by most of the participants. #

Only two users noticed this feature.

All participants expected the [dashboard]() to be customisable. However, for the majority, it was not clear how they could personalise it for two reasons:
‘Add panels’ is not prominent enough and the participants didn’t notice the link.

The name ‘Add panels’ was not an intuitive term for customisation. A few participants commented they were looking for the word ‘customise’.


**Recommendation**

+ *Consider changing ‘Add panels’ for ‘Customise your dashboard.’*
+ *Consider to make this section visually more obvious and prominent.*





# In the FX payments section, it was unclear which input field to use to enter the amount to be paid. #

The position of input boxes was confusing for the majority of participants. 10 out of 11 users intuitively entered the amount in the ‘Amount’ box on the left instead of ‘Payee will receive’ on the right and tried to select the currency rather than the payee amount.

The prototype tested on the second day, solved this issue by reducing the number of boxes (only ‘Amount payee will receive’ and ‘Currency’) and displaying the “This will cost you approximately” information.



**Recommendation**

+ *Make it simple to specify the key party / toggle e.g. one participant questioned how it would work if she wanted to pay a specific sterling amount.*



## The labels are not visually obvious enough so the participants didn’t notice anything beyond the first tab. ##

All participants started to enter data directly in the first tab ‘Pay a business or person’. In this section, they were asked to input an amount to be paid and select a currency, so they assumed they were in the right place to make an international payment.

**Recommendation**

*Make the tabs more visually obvious.*

+ *It needs to be more obvious for participants why they should go to ‘FX payments & transfers’ instead of ‘Pay a business or person’. Consider changing the name of ‘FX payments’ for ‘International payments’ or ‘Payments in another currency’.*
