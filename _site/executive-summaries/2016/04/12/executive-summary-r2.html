    <h1 id="vision-and-mid-term-goals-depends-mainly-on-companys-lifecycle-growth-vs-maturity">Vision and mid-term goals depends mainly on company’s lifecycle (growth vs. maturity)</h1>

<p>Businesses which are looking to grow have well-defined
goals 3-5 years ahead. Meanwhile, those who want to
stabilise would rather focus on the quality of service they
provide.</p>

<p>Businesses on the lower end of the spectrum (£2-5M)
seemed to be more receptive to receiving advice while
more mature businesses weren’t looking help from outside
sources.</p>

<h2 id="some-of-the-goals-were">Some of the goals were:</h2>
<p>• Becoming more independent e.g. move away from dependency on one big client or supplier.
• Opening new branches or stores.
• Increasing international trade.</p>

<h1 id="most-of-the-companies-miss-good-systems-to-analyse-their-business-better">Most of the companies miss good systems to analyse their business better</h1>

<p>Most of the companies rely heavily on Excel reports and accumulated knowledge from their employees. However, all recognise that it is a real issue for their business and they plan to invest in better digital solutions to help themunderstand their business in a more holistic way.</p>

<p>“No tools, just experienced
people right now. I’m about to
implement control structures to
allow better visibility.”
- Participant 3</p>

<p>“One person in the business
is the Excel wizard. If something
would happen to him, we wouldn’t
know what to do.”
- Participant 2</p>

<h1 id="overall-businesses-think-they-dont-have-any-blind-spots-what-not-always-its-true">Overall, businesses think they don’t have any blind spots what not always it’s true</h1>

<p>The companies who have a stable customer base and organic growth
believe that it’s unlikely that anything could affect their business
e.g. new competition. The economy is the biggest worry for them
and they are concerned about things such as: recession, political
changes, etc.</p>

<p>However, the interviews reveal that actually most of the
participants’ businesses have some serious issues, i.e. being
completely dependent on unique aluminium supply in China.
The blind spot term might be confusing. We should consider to use
another term such as weakness or worry.</p>

<p>“If the economy is running well,
our business runs well.”
- Participant 5</p>

<h1 id="role-of-technology-in-business-is-increasing">Role of technology in business is increasing</h1>

<p>Most businesses use SAGE for finances and other specialist
software. All admit that technology is crucial in their business and they plan
to invest in it.</p>

<p>“Tech is absolutely key and
becoming more and more
critical everyday… fundamental
to everything that we do.”
- Participant 6</p>

<h1 id="banks-are-perceived-as-a-facility-rather-than-a-business-partner">Banks are perceived as a facility rather than a business partner</h1>

<p>Banks are a convenience for most of the businesses. They are good
for lending, offering overdraft facilities, etc.</p>

<p>Customers don’t perceive the bank as experts in their business and
therefore don’t go to them outside of banking services advice or
needs.</p>

<p>“RM rings three times a
year and asks if we need
anything, but we don’t. We use it
mostly as a facility, take money
in and take it out.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 5</li>
</ul>

<p>“Banks are there to lend you
money, as long as they can do
that, they are doing their job.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 6</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="perception-that-banks-are-not-experts-in-my-business">Perception that banks are not experts in my business</h1>

<p>All participants claimed they need very specialised sector
knowledge such as local market trends or local benchmarking.
They don’t see the bank as a business advisor outside of their
financial needs and don’t expect the bank to give them expert
business advice.</p>

<p>They expect the bank to understand their business dynamics (e.g.
cash-flow) and to help them be more efficient with their money.
For example, suggesting where they should invest their money,
helping them negotiate better charges or rate deals etc.</p>

<p>“The banks use
national data - look at
things nationally, don’t look at
things on a local scale. This
business is difficult and I don’t
think they are capable of
specialist information.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 5</li>
</ul>

<p>“I would not look to
the bank for advice. They
are a jack of all trades and
master of none, and bank
specialists aren’t specialist
enough to understand
everybody’s business.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 4</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="rm-is-not-expected-to-be-an-expert-in-the-business">RM is not expected to be an expert in the business</h1>

<p>• An RM is not going to be more experienced or
knowledgeable than someone who has a run company
in an area for 30 years - they are not expected to be
an expert in that business
• What an RM can provide are connections to experts
who may be able to help with areas identified by the
business
• The RM needs to be informed enough about a
particular business to have a meaningful conversation
with their customers to identify potential resources,
connections, or events that could provide value to
their customers
• Customers would find networking events useful to
have more connections with suppliers or people in
their industry</p>

<h1 id="happy-to-use-an-online-tool-to-get-advice-from-the-bank-but-human-interaction-is-required-as-well">Happy to use an online tool to get advice from the bank, but human interaction is required as well</h1>

<p>Despite the fact most of the participants don’t consider their bank
as advisors to their business, in addition to providing financial
services, they would be open to exploring a service that would
provide them with relevant information.</p>

<p>Participants were keen to talk to any expert from the bank, not only
their RMs. They recognise their RM might have a very limited.</p>

<p>“There is so much that is
online, I would quite like to speak
to somebody.”
- Participant 7</p>

<h1 id="relationship-with-the-bank-is-perceived-through-experience-they-have-with-their-rms">Relationship with the bank is perceived through experience they have with their RMs</h1>

<p>Because RMs are a key touch-point, the overall perception
businesses have about the bank is influenced by the quality of
experience they have with RMs.</p>

<p>Most participants interact with their RM a few times per year.
Their interactions with them is driven by a specific need or issue
they need to resolve. However, some participants complained it’s
hard to establish a close relationship with them because of the
high turn-over. They wish their RM would be more proactive and
contact them more.</p>

<p>The age factor is important and young RMs might be perceived
as inexperienced.</p>

<p>There was a positive RM experience when there was a team of
people who could be contacted to support a business query.</p>

<p>“20 years ago, you had
RMs who would come in… they
would be keen on knowing what the
business was, they were older
members. Now what we’re getting is
people coming in without the lifeskills,
a much younger generation.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 5</li>
</ul>

<p>“RM should not bother me
if he has nothing valuable to
offer. I am not his friend to have
a chat on how I am doing. I am a
very busy person.”
knowledge about their sector/industry.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 4</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="comms-from-the-bank-are-consider-generic-and-irrelevant">Comms from the bank are consider generic and irrelevant</h1>

<p>Most of the participants like the fact the bank send them
newsletter and updates over email. However, they admit
to not paying much attention to the information.
The information sent by the bank is perceived as generic,
irrelevant, not suitable for their specific business needs.
“How to push my business forward” email aroused some
attention - but the content was not meaningful enough to
those who received it.</p>

<p>“I can Google that myself.”
- Participant 8</p>

<p>“Communication that is
received over email is generic -
prize draw for the rugby match,
budget forecast, telling me how
to grow my business”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 7</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="banks-have-full-disclosure">Banks have full disclosure</h1>

<p>All participants claimed they would be happy to provide the
bank, via an online tool, with any financial information such as
records, cash-flow, etc.</p>

<p>They were willing to dedicate some time using an online tool to
get information that would be of value for their business. The
more information which customers provide, the more value
they expect to get out of the information they receive that is
pertinent to their interest (business, sector, location).</p>

<p>“They have all our information
anyway, RBS has all the details
on our accounts.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 5</li>
</ul>

<p>“I would be happy to provide
information with the bank ‘open
book’.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participant 6</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="other-comments">Other comments:</h1>

<p>• RM needs to be able to leverage the banks knowledge
network to do predictive analysis - knowledge that a
smaller business won’t be privy to.
• Information tool will be most useful to business under
£5 million.
• RM to introduce business to supply chain alternatives.
• Businesses would like specific industry knowledge
specific to business size, e.g. Local business, local
knowledge.
• RM to understand how business works. e.g. NHS
payment is 3 months behind prescription submission.
• Give Business ideas on how to best diversify. Take on
mid-term goals and give them case studies on similar
business growth plan ideas</p>
